+ 880. Decoded String at Index
Working backwards
+ 1130. Minimum Cost Tree From Leaf Values
Seems like a Tree problem, but it's a DP problem(n^3 -> n^3 -> monostack + greedy On)
+ 898. Bitwise ORs of Subarrays
Time complexity is not O n^2 but O 30n, since we only have 30 different results at each level.
+ 1163. Last Substring in Lexicographical Order
Greedy problem. Always find the maximum starting letter and compare the rest of it. Also need to skip the duplicate max letter.
