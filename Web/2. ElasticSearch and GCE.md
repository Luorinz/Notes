# Introduction to Around
Demo: http://recordit.co/awrQb1zn2I

`Around`: a Geo-index based social network

•	Built a scalable web service in Go to handle posts and deployed to Google Cloud (GAE flex) for better scaling

•	Utilized ElasticSearch (GCE) to provide geo-location based search functions such that users can search nearby posts within a distance (e.g. 200km)

•	Used Google Dataflow to implement a daily dump of posts to BigQuery table for offline analysis

•	Aggregated the data at the post level and user level to improve the keyword based spam detection (BigQuery)


# Create a new cloud project.

Step 2.1.1 Open https://console.cloud.google.com/ and sign in with your gmail account. 

Choose Sign up for free trial, enter a credit card (Must do). GCP has $300 discount for new users, which is enough for project purpose. 

Step 2.1.2 Click ‘My Project’. Create a new Project called ‘Around’. Google Cloud will automatically generate a new project id for you. 

# Geo-Index and ElasticSearch

how to perform 1-d range search? For example, given a 1-d binary search tree, find all the values between [3, 18]. 
![ElasticSearch and GCE-2019-4-28-14-47-57.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Luorinz/images/master/ElasticSearch%20and%20GCE-2019-4-28-14-47-57.png)
 

What about 2d data? 
+ Geo index: lat between [10.2, 10.3] and lon between [120.0, 120.5]
+ Price between [$10, $100], date between [Jan-01-2017, Jun-01-2017]
+ Weight between [120pb,140pb], height between [150cm, 180cm]
+ ...

K-D tree is one implementation to solve such k-dimensional search problem.

Then we choose one median point and split the space into two parts horizontally.

Continue to split them into more parts (vertically)

Question: how to find all the points within a Range (R)?
 
![ElasticSearch and GCE-2019-4-28-14-48-32.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Luorinz/images/master/ElasticSearch%20and%20GCE-2019-4-28-14-48-32.png)

Range Search Algorithm:
+ If query box doesn’t overlap bounding box, stop recursion 
+ If bounding box is a subset of query box, report all the points in current subtree
+ If bounding box overlaps query box, recurse left and right

## ELK (ElasticSearch, Logstash and Kibana)

`Elasticsearch` is an open source, distributed, RESTful search engine. As the heart of the Elastic Stack, it centrally stores your data so you can query the data quickly.

> SQL is slower. Since ELK uses a pair to search directly.

```SQL
SELECT * FROM LOCATIONS WHERE lat <= 12 AND lat >= 10 AND lon >= 120 AND lon <= 130
```

The overall structure (tech stack) of our project:

![1. Go and Web Service-2019-4-27-13-55-46.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Luorinz/images/master/1.%20Go%20and%20Web%20Service-2019-4-27-13-55-46.png)


__Question__: why we need such a complicated infrastructure

__Answer__: because in industry, we need to handle very different requirements compared to in school. 

## Configure

### Find NETWORKING -> VPC network -> Firewall rules

Click `CREATE FIREWALL RULE`

In the next page, give it a name like `‘elasticsearch’`. Set the Target tags to be `‘es’`, source IP ranges to be `‘0.0.0.0/0’`, and the specified protocols and ports to be `‘tcp:9200’`. 

Wait until the firewall rules is created. 

### Find Compute Engine->VM instances

Choose ‘Change’ and switch to Ubuntu 16. Keep the size of 10GB is fine. 

Then in the Networking -> Network tags, set it to be `‘es’` (the firewall rule that we created). 

### After one minute, you will see the instance is started. Choose `‘SSH’` and then ‘Open in browser window’. 

### In the terminal, enter

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install default-jre
```

It will install java to your vm. To verify, enter `‘which java’` and `‘java -version’` to check

Install ElasticSearch as below 

```
wget https://download.elastic.co/elasticsearch/release/org/elasticsearch/distribution/deb/elasticsearch/2.3.1/elasticsearch-2.3.1.deb
sudo dpkg -i elasticsearch-2.3.1.deb
sudo systemctl enable elasticsearch.service
```


Edit the configuration file

```
sudo vim /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml
```
Add two lines to the config, to allow all traffic and listen on port 9200.

```
network.host: 0.0.0.0
http.port: 9200
```

Save this and Start ElasticSearch

```
sudo service elasticsearch start
```

Check the status of ElasticSearch
```
sudo service elasticsearch status
```
You should be able to see ‘active’ in the status


Back to your console.cloud.google.com, find the public IP address(external)

Put the IP address and port together (:9200) in a new tab and see whether the server is on. The name or version might be different.

> NOTE: Don’t use https! Should use http.

You should get something like this:

```Json
{
  "name" : "Honey Lemon",
  "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
  "version" : {
    "number" : "2.3.1",
    "build_hash" : "bd980929010aef404e7cb0843e61d0665269fc39",
    "build_timestamp" : "2016-04-04T12:25:05Z",
    "build_snapshot" : false,
    "lucene_version" : "5.5.0"
  },
  "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
}
```

Which means your ES server is running as expected. 


## Update Go Code

### Update handlerSearch


Original source of codes (https://olivere.github.io/elastic/)  

> In here we have to import source code of elastic.(v3)

```
To get the package, execute:

go get gopkg.in/olivere/elastic.v3

To import this package, add the following line to your code:

import "gopkg.in/olivere/elastic.v3"

Refer to it as elastic.
```

```Go
func handlerSearch(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
      fmt.Println("Received one request for search")
      lat, _ := strconv.ParseFloat(r.URL.Query().Get("lat"), 64)
      lon, _ := strconv.ParseFloat(r.URL.Query().Get("lon"), 64)

      // range is optional 
      ran := DISTANCE 
      if val := r.URL.Query().Get("range"); val != "" { 
         ran = val + "km" 
      }

     fmt.Printf( "Search received: %f %f %s\n", lat, lon, ran)

      // Create a client
      client, err := elastic.NewClient(elastic.SetURL(ES_URL), elastic.SetSniff(false))
      if err != nil {
             panic(err)
             return
      }

      // Define geo distance query as specified in
      // https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.2/query-dsl-geo-distance-query.html
      q := elastic.NewGeoDistanceQuery("location")
      q = q.Distance(ran).Lat(lat).Lon(lon)

      // Some delay may range from seconds to minutes. So if you don't get enough results. Try it later.
      searchResult, err := client.Search().
             Index(INDEX).
             Query(q).
             Pretty(true).
             Do()
      if err != nil {
             // Handle error
             panic(err)
      }

      // searchResult is of type SearchResult and returns hits, suggestions,
      // and all kinds of other information from Elasticsearch.
      fmt.Printf("Query took %d milliseconds\n", searchResult.TookInMillis)
      // TotalHits is another convenience function that works even when something goes wrong.
      fmt.Printf("Found a total of %d post\n", searchResult.TotalHits())

      // Each is a convenience function that iterates over hits in a search result.
      // It makes sure you don't need to check for nil values in the response.
      // However, it ignores errors in serialization.
      var typ Post
      var ps []Post
      for _, item := range searchResult.Each(reflect.TypeOf(typ)) { // instance of
             p := item.(Post) // p = (Post) item
             fmt.Printf("Post by %s: %s at lat %v and lon %v\n", p.User, p.Message, p.Location.Lat, p.Location.Lon)
             // TODO(student homework): Perform filtering based on keywords such as web spam etc.
             ps = append(ps, p)

      }
      js, err := json.Marshal(ps)
      if err != nil {
             panic(err)
             return
      }

      w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/json")
      w.Header().Set("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")
      w.Write(js)
}

```

## Code explanation
Let’s explain these codes line by line
```Go
client, err := elastic.NewClient(elastic.SetURL(ES_URL), elastic.SetSniff(false)) 
```
It means we create a connection to ES. If there is err, return. 

```Go
q := elastic.NewGeoDistanceQuery("location")
```
Prepare a geo based query to find posts within a geo box.

```Go
searchResult, err := client.Search().
             Index(INDEX).
             Query(q).
             Pretty(true).
             Do()
```

Get the results based on `Index` (similar to `dataset`) and `query` (`q` that we just prepared). `Pretty` means to format the output. 

```Go
for _, item := range searchResult.Each(reflect.TypeOf(typ)) {
```

Iterate the result in results which are type of Post (typ)

```Go
p := item.(Post) 
```

Cast an item to Post, equals to `p = (Post) item`  in java

```Go
ps = append(ps, p)
```

Add the p to an array, equals `ps.add(p)` in java

```Go
js, err := json.Marshal(ps)
```

Convert the go object(array) to a string
```Go
w.Header().Set("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")
```
Allow cross domain visit for javascript.

We also need to put ES library in import
```Go
import (
      elastic "gopkg.in/olivere/elastic.v3"
      "fmt"
      "net/http"
      "encoding/json"
      "log"
      "strconv"
      "reflect"
)
```

Add const before main function

```Go
const (
      INDEX = "around"
      TYPE = "post"
      DISTANCE = "200km"
      // Needs to update
      //PROJECT_ID = "around-xxx"
      //BT_INSTANCE = "around-post"
      // Needs to update this URL if you deploy it to cloud.
      ES_URL = "http://YOUR_ES_IP_ADDRESS:9200"
)

func main() {
      fmt.Println("started-service")
      http.HandleFunc("/post", handlerPost)
      http.HandleFunc("/search", handlerSearch)
      log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil))
}
```


Replace `YOUR_ES_IP_ADDRESS` with your ES address (public IP).
> http://externalIp:9200


Step 2.2.5 Open your terminal (Mac and Windows). Enter

```
go get  gopkg.in/olivere/elastic.v3
```

Once it is done, you won’t be able to see any more compile errors in Intellij. If it does not work (elastic is still red), try to restart it.

Step 2.2.6 In order to create index in ES, we need to update main

__What’s mapping in ES?__ It tells you what’s the type of a variable if not default.

```Go
func main() {
	// Create a client
	client, err := elastic.NewClient(elastic.SetURL(ES_URL), elastic.SetSniff(false))
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
		return
	}

	// Use the IndexExists service to check if a specified index exists.
	exists, err := client.IndexExists(INDEX).Do()
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	if !exists {
		// Create a new index.
		mapping := `{
			"mappings":{
				"post":{
					"properties":{
						"location":{
							"type":"geo_point"
						}
					}
				}
			}
		}`
		_, err := client.CreateIndex(INDEX).Body(mapping).Do()
		if err != nil {
			// Handle error
			panic(err)
		}
	}

	fmt.Println("started-service")
	http.HandleFunc("/post", handlerPost)
	http.HandleFunc("/search", handlerSearch)
	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil))
}
```

```Go
exists, err := client.IndexExists(INDEX).Do()
```

Check if the index exists. 


```Go
mapping := `{
                    "mappings":{
                           "post":{
                                  "properties":{
                                         "location":{
                                                "type":"geo_point"
                                         }
                                  }
                           }
                    }
```

If not, create a new mapping. For other fields (user, message, etc.) no need to have mapping as they are default. For geo location (lat, lon), we need to tell ES that they are geo points instead of two float points such that ES will use Geo-indexing for them (K-D tree)

```Go
 _, err := client.CreateIndex(INDEX).Body(mapping).Do()
 ```

Create this index

Step 2.2.7 Update handlerPost

Add external import of uuid

```Go
import (
      elastic "gopkg.in/olivere/elastic.v3"
      "fmt"
      "net/http"
      "encoding/json"
      "log"
      "strconv"
      "reflect"
      "github.com/pborman/uuid"
)
```

How to add a new document to the index?

https://github.com/olivere/elastic has an example

```Go
// Add a document to the index
// Refresh(true) means if duplicate appears, overwrite it
tweet := Tweet{User: "olivere", Message: "Take Five"}
_, err = client.Index().
    Index("twitter").
    Type("tweet").
    Id("1").
    BodyJson(tweet).
    Refresh(true).
    Do(ctx)
if err != nil {
    // Handle error
    panic(err)
}
```

Student Question: how to complete this one?

```Go
func handlerPost(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
      // Parse from body of request to get a json object.
      fmt.Println("Received one post request")
      decoder := json.NewDecoder(r.Body)
      var p Post
      if err := decoder.Decode(&p); err != nil {
             panic(err)
             return
      }
      id := uuid.New()
      // Save to ES.
      saveToES(&p, id)

}

// Save a post to ElasticSearch
func saveToES(p *Post, id string) {
	// Create a client
	es_client, err := elastic.NewClient(elastic.SetURL(ES_URL), elastic.SetSniff(false))
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
		return
	}

	// Save it to index
	_, err = es_client.Index().
		Index(INDEX).
		Type(TYPE).
		Id(id).
		BodyJson(p).
		Refresh(true).
		Do()
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
		return
	}

	fmt.Printf("Post is saved to Index: %s\n", p.Message)
}
```


Step 2.2.8 Open terminal, enter

```
go get github.com/pborman/uuid
```

Make sure your ES_URL is updated from your aws instance in step 1.

Step 2.2.9 Run your main.go again

## Errors
If you have such an error, your ES_URL is incorrect.

```
panic: no Elasticsearch node available
```

If you have such error, you have started two `main.go`, stop the other one.

```
2017/06/30 07:07:01 listen tcp :8080: bind: Only one usage of each socket address (protocol/network address/port) is normally permitted.
exit status 1
```

If you have such error, you forgot to comment one line `fmt.Fprintf(w, "Search received: %s %s %s", lat, lon, ran)`.

```
Search received: %!s(float64=37.4) %...
```

Step 2.2.10 Open Postman, find the post query from history. (POST, http://localhost:8080/post)

```Json
{
	"user":"1111",
	"message":"一生必去的100个地方",
	"location":{
		"lat":37.5,
		"lon":-120.1
	}
}
```

And then find the get query from history. (GET, url=http://localhost:8080/search?lat=37.5&lon=-120)
You should get the results back

```Json
[
    {
        "user": "1111",
        "message": "一生必去的100个地方",
        "location": {
            "lat": 37.5,
            "lon": -120.1
        }
    }
]
```

Post more examples with different locations and then get with different lat/lon to see how many results you may get. If you have zero result back and no error, probably your geo location is wrong.
