# Bigtable
`BigTable` is one of the first `NoSQL` solutions in the world. It's the same database that powers many core Google services, including Search, Analytics, Maps, and Gmail. 

`Apache HBase` is the open source version of BigTable.

By definition, A `Bigtable` is a `sparse`, `distributed`, `persistent multidimensional sorted map`. (In my word, it’s a key­value store.) The map is indexed by a row key, column key, and a timestamp; each value in the map is an uninterpreted array of bytes.


## Main features that you must know about BigTable

+ Map
+ Persistent: BigTable vs. Memcache
+ Distributed (GFS/HDFS, etc.): data is replicated across a number of participating nodes vs. MySQL
+ Multidimensional: row, column (column family), timestamp. You may scan based on their ranges.
+ Sparse: A given row can have any number of columns in each column family, or none at
all. The other type of sparseness is row­based gaps, which merely means that there may be gaps between keys.

## BigTable vs. ElasticSearch vs. Datastore vs....

+ BigTable is persistent storage (ES is not persistent, may lose data)
+ ElasticSearch is search engine with complicated query support and better read
performance
+ BigQuery is for offline analysis not for serving user traffic (scale is small)
+ MongoDB is NoSQL.
+ BigTable vs. ElasticSearch vs. MongoDB vs. BigQuery vs. Dataflow
    + BigTable = NoSQL + Cloud
    + MongoDB = NoSQL
    + ElasticSearch = NoSQL + Query Optimization
    + BigQuery = MySQL­like + Cloud
    + Dataflow = MapReduce + Cloud


Interview question:

Why you need BigTable (or BigQuery) while you already have ElasticSearch (BigTable/BigQuery)

Bigtable has a concept of `column family` and `column`. `Column family` is a set of columns.

Question: Why column family?
Answer: allow better management of data such as versioning strategy.

## Create BigTable in Google Cloud

Click this link https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/quickstart­cbt and then click ‘`ENABLE THE APIS`’

### To Enable an API.

### Open ‘BigTable’ in Google Cloud,

### Create an instance called ‘around­post’. Change instance type to development.

Set the type to ssd and instance type to development

### Enter gcloud in your terminal

Install cbt in your cloud terminal (not your local terminal). When asked ‘Do you want to continue?’ Enter y. Proceed without waiting it to finish.

```
sudo gcloud components update sudo gcloud components install cbt
```     

To ensure cbt is installed, enter `which cbt` in your cloud terminal If you don’t see it, you cbt is not installed, please do the install again.

```
/google/google-cloud-sdk/bin/cbt
```


In your cloud terminal, enter

```
echo project = YOUR_PROJECT_ID > ~/.cbtrc echo instance = around­post >> ~/.cbtrc
cbt createtable post
cbt createfamily post post 
cbt createfamily post location
```

If you see such results, the bigtable column and column family are both created (This step is a MUST for next lessons). Please check it carefully.

## Write data into BigTable
### Open your local terminal and cloud terminal, enter

```
go get cloud.google.com/go/bigtable
```

Instructions on writing data to BigTable
+ https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/go/reference


### Update your code in handlerPost and saveToBigTable. Replace project name with your project.
```Go
func saveToBigTable(p *Post, id string) {
	ctx := context.Background()
	// you must update project name here
	bt_client, err := bigtable.NewClient(ctx, PROJECT_ID, BT_INSTANCE)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
		return
	}

	tbl := bt_client.Open("post")
	mut := bigtable.NewMutation()
	t := bigtable.Now()
	
	mut.Set("post", "user", t, []byte(p.User))
	mut.Set("post", "message", t, []byte(p.Message))
	mut.Set("location", "lat", t, []byte(strconv.FormatFloat(p.Location.Lat, 'f', -1, 64)))
	mut.Set("location", "lon", t, []byte(strconv.FormatFloat(p.Location.Lon, 'f', -1, 64)))

	err = tbl.Apply(ctx, id, mut)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
		return
	}
	fmt.Printf("Post is saved to Big Table : %s\n", p.Message)

}
```

Based on what Google suggest, how to save our Post into BT?
```Go
tbl := client.Open("mytable")
mut := bigtable.NewMutation()

mut.Set("links", "maps.google.com", bigtable.Now(), []byte("1")) 

mut.Set("links", "golang.org", bigtable.Now(), []byte("1"))

err := tbl.Apply(ctx, "com.google.cloud", mut)
```



Uncomment the two lines in const and replace the `PROJECT_ID` with your own project id.

```Go
const (
INDEX = "around"
TYPE = "post"
DISTANCE = "200km"
// Needs to update with your real project id PROJECT_ID = "xxxx"
BT_INSTANCE = "around­post"
// Needs to update this URL if you deploy it to cloud. ES_URL = "http://AWS_ADDRESS:9200"
)
```

Add two imports

```Go
package main

import (
elastic "gopkg.in/olivere/elastic.v3" "fmt"
"net/http"
"encoding/json"
"log"
"strconv"
"reflect"
"context" "cloud.google.com/go/bigtable" "github.com/pborman/uuid"
)
```

Try to build it locally to see if there are any errors.

```
go build *.go
```

### Update your codes in cloud terminal (Either copy or github) Offer share

### After you copy or update codes into cloud terminal, do a deployment again.

### Open Postman, test post and search

### Read data from BigTable

### In the cloud terminal, enter 

```
cbt read post
```

You should be able to find all the entries stored in BT.


### How to debug? Check Logging­>logs.
Note that: if you close your cloud terminal, you may or may not need to install cbt again as cloud terminal is actually a vm.
