Google Cloud Dataflow is a unified programming model and a managed service for developing and executing a wide range of data processing patterns including ETL (Extract, Transform and Load), batch computation, and continuous computation.
Unified Programming Model: The Dataflow API enables you to express MapReduce like operations, powerful data windowing, and fine grained correctness control regardless of data source.
Why we need Dataflow?
● Only care about your business logics instead of implementation details.
● Scans much better than your own clusters.
● Why we need multiple steps instead of just one huge task?
○ Scales different in different steps
