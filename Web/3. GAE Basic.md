# Google Cloud Platform

## GAE (Google App Engine)

`Google App Engine` is a cloud computing platform for developing and hosting web applications in Google-managed data centers.
 
## GCE (Google Compute Engine)

`Google Compute Engine` delivers virtual machines running in Google's innovative data centers and worldwide fiber network.
 
## GKE (Google Container Engine) 

https://cloud.google.com/containers/

## Dataflow

`Dataflow` is a unified programming model and a managed service for developing and executing a wide range of data processing patterns including ETL, batch computation, and continuous computation.
 
## BigTable

`Cloud Bigtable` is Google's NoSQL Big Data database service. It's the same database that powers many core Google services, including Search, Analytics, Maps, and Gmail.
 
## BigQuery

`BigQuery` is Google's fully managed, petabyte scale, low cost enterprise data warehouse for analytics.

+ Service (GAE/GKE) to receive user generated contents
+ Datastore (BigTable/Spanner) to save contents
+ Index (ElasticSearch) to query contents in runtime
+ Service (GAE/GKE) to serve contents in runtime
+ Dataflow (MapReduce) to dump data into BigQuery
+ BigQuery (SQL) to perform further analysis

> GKE is more like a simple GCE

# Google App Engine Flex
`App Engine flexible environment ` automatically scales your app up and down while balancing the load. Microservices, authorization, SQL and NoSQL databases, traffic splitting, logging. 

Step 3.1.1 In your Intellij, create a new file called `app.yaml`

The content has just two lines.

> GAE 通过flex实现负载均衡

```yaml
runtime: go
env: flex
```

__Recommended__: upload your two files (main.go and app.yaml) into github. 

Worst cast: just copy and paste in terminals.

# Setup cloud terminal.
Question: Why use cloud terminal? 
Answer: Such that we do not rely on the local environment (Windows vs. Mac). 

## Click ‘Activate Google Cloud Shell’.  Wait until the init is done

Then you will see a vm available for you to play. This is similar to the EC2 vm.

## Install go libraries in gcloud terminal.

```
go get gopkg.in/olivere/elastic.v3
go get github.com/pborman/uuid
```

## (Recommended) Checkout your codes from github

git clone https://github.com/Luorinz/Around.git


__Question__: what’s the purpose of app.yaml?

__Answer__: to tell google that your program is a go program and use go compiler to run it.

Then enter this line of code to make sure you copy past is done.

```
cat main.go | head -n 5
```

You’re expected to see this
```
package main

import (
        elastic "gopkg.in/olivere/elastic.v3"
        "fmt"
```

## Enter `gcloud app deploy`

When asked about site, enter 1, which is `us-west2`
 

When asked Y/n, enter Y. The deployment may take more than 10 minutes to finish (next deployment will be faster).
 

Error: If you have error like this, you may have a wrong ES_URL. Update the value and deploy again.

```
Updating service [default]...failed.                                                                                         
ERROR: (gcloud.app.deploy) Error Response: [9] 
Application startup error:
+ exec app
panic: no Elasticsearch node available
```

## Open Postman, find the post query from history. 
`(POST, url=http://xxx.appspot.com/post) `

Replace xxx with your real project id

```Json
{
	"user":"1111",
	"message":"一生必去的100个地方",
	"location":{
		"lat":37.5,
		"lon":-120.1
	}
}
```

And then find the get query from history. (GET, url=http://around-xxxx.appspot.com/search?lat=37.5&lon=-120)
You should get the results back

```Json
[
    {
        "user": "1111",
        "message": "一生必去的100个地方",
        "location": {
            "lat": 37.5,
            "lon": -120.1
        }
    }
]
```

Play with more examples. If you do not have any results back, try to change your lat or lon to make sure it’s within 200km.


## Check the logging to see if there is any error message

Choose SATCKDRIVER -> Logging -> Logs
 
## (Optional) Stop Instance to save credit.
 

## (Optional) Start the instance again. In the same page, choose one instance and click START. If the START is disabled, refresh it or wait a minute.

## (Optional) How to filter word 

```Go
func containsFilteredWords(s *string) bool {
        filteredWords := []string{
                "fuck",
                "100",
        }
        for _, word := range filteredWords {
                if strings.Contains(*s, word) {
                        return true
                }
        }
        return false
}
```

Update relevant part from your code

```Go
func handlerSearch(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {

        ...

        for _, item := range searchResult.Each(reflect.TypeOf(typ)) {
                p := item.(Post)
                fmt.Printf("Post by %s: %s at lat %v and lon %v\n", p.User, p.Message, p.Location.Lat, p.Location.Lon)
                // TODO(vincent): Perform filtering based on keywords such as web spam etc.
                if !containsFilteredWords(&p.Message) {
                        ps = append(ps, p)
                }

        }

        ...
}
```

## (Optional) Useful Go information

### Error vs Panic
+ Error: normal way to handle error status.
+ Panic: normally used when some “impossible” situation happens with no intend recover.

    + Use “recover” to handle when exiting function.
    + recover is like catch

### “defer” clause
+ Preferred way to recycle resources
    + E.g. file handles, network connections, etc.
    + Defer executes after return
    + First come last executes
    + Example

```Go
func Foo() {
        var f File
        if f, err = os.Open(“Somefile”); err != nil {
                panic(“Error open file”)
        }
        defer f.Close()

        ...

        // some other error happens
        if err != nil  {
                panic(“Unexpected error”)
        }
}
```

+ Combined with recover to handle panic

```Go
func Foo() result string, err error {
        type openFileError struct{}
        type unexpectedError struct{}

        defer func() {
                switch p := recover(); p {
                case nil:
                        // no panic
                case openFileError{}:
                        err = fmt.Errorf(“Open file error”)
                case unexpectedError{}:
                        err = fmt.Errorf(“Unexpected error”)
                default:
                        panic(p)
                }
        }()

        var f File
        if f, err = os.Open(“Somefile”); err != nil {
                panic(openFileError{})
        }
        defer f.Close()

        // Some work...

        // Some other error happens
        if err != nil  {
                panic(unexpectedError{})
        }

        return result, nil
}
